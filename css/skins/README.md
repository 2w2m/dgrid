This folder contains skins based on the Dijit themes (claro, tundra, soria, and nihilo).
The skins are based on generic skin elements from the jquery-ui themeroller CSS
convention. The d-list component follows this convention therefore these skins can
be used on the d-list, providing skins that match the Dijit themes. Any other stylesheet
based on the themeroller convention can also be used to skin the d-list.
